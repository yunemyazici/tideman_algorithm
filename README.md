CS50 Week3 Problem Set Tideman


I have implemented Tideman's election algorithm on this project. It helped me to learn how could we represent different kinds of relationships in code such as arrows and winners in this project. Most importantly, this project is my first project that I brainstormed to create a well-designed algorithm. It showed me that creating an algorithm to solve a problem does not only consist the coding part, first we have to specify how and by using what we are going to solve the problem.
